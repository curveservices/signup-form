The <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form">Sign up Form</a> assigment was set as part of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">**The Odin Project**</a> as the first project of the Intermediate HTML & CSS course. The Javascript part of this assignment was optional.

## Objectives

1. Build a sign-up form page based on the provided assets
2. The inputs, by default have a very light border (#E5E7EB), include 2 variations. For starters, the password inputs should be given an error class.
3. The other variation is the selected input, which should have a blue border and subtle box-shadow. This can be done with the :focus pseudo-class
4. No need to make it look nice for mobile.
5. Checking that the password fields match each other requires javascript. Try to implement this if you feel confident, otherwise just validate each field separately.
